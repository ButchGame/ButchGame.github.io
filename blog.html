		<div class = "panel">
			<p>We all got together this week and spent some time getting to know each other. Things seem to be going pretty well with the ice-breakers and we've decided on what roles we'll each be taking on based on our skills. There have been some ideas about what our game will be, ranging from a cowboy shoot 'em up, to a Star Wars'esque adventure game. It's definitely given us some things to think about over the next few weeks!</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class = "card">
		<button class = "accordion">Week 2</button>
		<div class = "panel">
			<p>After hours of debate, we have finally decided on the story and genre of the game. There's not a whole lot that we can say at this point other than with Red Dead Redemption 2 releasing soon we thought it would be great to have a crack at our own wild-west game. While the story isn't finalised, we can announce the protagonist: Butch Cassidy. Yes you heard right, this is going to be the story about the infamous cowboy and his adventures through the dustland plains of America!</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class = "card">
		<button class = "accordion">Week 4</button>
		<div class = "panel">
			<p>With the pitch of the game out of the way, the developers have dived head first into development, already starting to build up a user interface for the game and managed to get a little cowboy outline to move around the screen. Whilst our creative team is still ironing out the storyline and map ideas, Stephen (our lead graphic designer) has already come up with a few versions of Butch for us to consider. It's going to be a tough choice but I'm sure we'll pick the right ones.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class = "card">
		<button class = "accordion">Week 6</button>
		<div class = "panel">
			<p>With the first implementation of our weapon system working in the game we can finally start getting into the action. We have a sprite up for the enemy, it just stands there like a lemon, but it's something! We've got a map with a building and a collision around it so things are starting to take shape for the demo coming up!</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class = "card">
		<button class = "accordion">Week 7</button>
		<div class = "panel">
			<p>Another busy week behind us and we have working enemies who walk around firing at the player! Another great milestone for the development team as now some of the sprites designed by Stephen are being added in along with the animations for the player moving around. With more life being breathed into the game the momentum seems to be increasing as we head towards the MVP.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class = "card">
		<button class = "accordion">Week 8</button>
		<div class = "panel">
			<p>We now have three maps filled with enemies, items and NPCs. This has been a long week for all those involved and we've managed to give the game a massive makeover, with it now looking better with every commit! We're all prepping for the MVP and have ordered our cowboy hats and bandanas for some extra style!</p>
